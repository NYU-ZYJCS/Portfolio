Kubernetes is an open-source platform designed to automate deploying, scaling, and operating application containers. It groups containers that make up an application into logical units for easy management and discovery.

I knew that to truly understand Kubernetes, I had to dive deep into its architecture, so I set up a local cluster and started experimenting with various components.

## What is Kubernetes?

Kubernetes, also known as K8s, was originally developed by Google and is now maintained by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation. It provides a framework to run distributed systems resiliently. It takes care of scaling and failover for your application, provides deployment patterns, and more.

### Key Concepts

1. **Cluster**: A set of nodes used to run containerized applications managed by Kubernetes.
2. **Node**: A single machine in a Kubernetes cluster, which can be either a virtual or physical machine.
3. **Pod**: The smallest and simplest Kubernetes object. A pod represents a single instance of a running process in your cluster.
4. **Service**: An abstraction which defines a logical set of pods and a policy by which to access them.
5. **Deployment**: Provides declarative updates to applications. It allows you to describe an applicationâ€™s lifecycle, such as which images to use for the app, the number of pod replicas, and the update strategy.
