## Introduction to DFS and BFS

Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS) are two fundamental algorithms used for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. Both algorithms can be used to solve a variety of problems, but they do so in different ways, which makes each one more suitable for certain types of problems.

### Depth-First Search (DFS)

DFS is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. The algorithm starts at the root (selecting some arbitrary node as the root in the case of a graph) and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.

### DFS Implementation (Recursive)

```cpp
void DFSRecursive(int node, vector<vector<int>>& graph, vector<bool>& visited) {
    visited[node] = true;
    // Process the node (e.g., print it)
    for (int neighbor : graph[node]) {
        if (!visited[neighbor]) {
            DFSRecursive(neighbor, graph, visited);
        }
    }
}
```

### DFS Implementation (Iterative)

```cpp
void DFSIterative(int startNode, vector<vector<int>>& graph) {
    stack<int> s;
    vector<bool> visited(graph.size(), false);
    s.push(startNode);
    while (!s.empty()) {
        int node = s.top();
        s.pop();
        if (!visited[node]) {
            visited[node] = true;
            // Process the node (e.g., print it)
            for (int neighbor : graph[node]) {
                if (!visited[neighbor]) {
                    s.push(neighbor);
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### DFS Characteristics
- **Space Complexity**: DFS has a space complexity of O(V) in the worst case, where V is the number of vertices in the graph.
- **Application**: Useful in scenarios where you need to explore all possible paths (e.g., solving mazes, puzzles, etc.).
- **Traversal Order**: DFS goes deep into the graph/tree before visiting the next sibling.


## Breadth-First Search (BFS)
BFS is another algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. 
It starts at the tree root (or an arbitrary node in a graph) and explores the neighbor nodes at 
the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level.

### BFS Implementation

```cpp
void BFS(int startNode, vector<vector<int>>& graph) {
    queue<int> q;
    vector<bool> visited(graph.size(), false);
    q.push(startNode);
    visited[startNode] = true;
    while (!q.empty()) {
        int node = q.front();
        q.pop();
        // Process the node (e.g., print it)
        for (int neighbor : graph[node]) {
            if (!visited[neighbor]) {
                visited[neighbor] = true;
                q.push(neighbor);
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### BFS Characteristics

- **Space Complexity**: BFS has a space complexity of O(V) in the worst case, where V is the number of vertices in the graph.
- **Application**: Useful in scenarios where you need to find the shortest path between two nodes.
- **Traversal Order**: BFS visits all nodes at the current depth level before moving on to the next level.

### Differences Between DFS and BFS

- **Traversal Order**: DFS dives deep into the graph/tree, exploring as far as possible along one branch before backtracking. BFS, on the other hand, explores all nodes at the current level before moving on to the next level.
- **Space Complexity**: DFS typically uses less memory when implemented recursively, but can have similar space complexity to BFS when using the iterative approach with a stack. BFS uses a queue, which may grow large in size if the graph/tree is wide.

### Use Cases:

- **DFS** is more suitable for scenarios where you need to explore all possible paths (e.g., finding connected components, solving puzzles like mazes).
- **BFS** is ideal for finding the shortest path in unweighted graphs, or for exploring nodes layer by layer (e.g., finding the minimum number of moves in a game).
