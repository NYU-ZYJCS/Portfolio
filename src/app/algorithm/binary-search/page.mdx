Binary search is an efficient algorithm for finding an item from a sorted list of items. It works by repeatedly dividing in half the portion of the list that could contain the item until you've narrowed down the possible locations to just one.


To get a better grasp of binary search, let's dive into its implementation and some of its variants.

## Binary Search Algorithm
Binary search works on the principle of divide and conquer. Here is the basic implementation:

### Left-Colsed Right-Open Interval `[left, right)`

- The `left` pointer starts at 0, representing the first element of the array.
- The `right` pointer ends at `nums.size()`, representing the position just after the last element of the array. 
- Because this is an open interval, we use `nums.size()`. If we used `nums.size() - 1`, we wouldn't include the last element.

However, using `right` as `nums.size() - 1` can also work because the condition `left = mid + 1` will ensure that
 the element at `nums.size() - 1`, which would normally be excluded, is included in the search.


```cpp
// Left-Closed Right-Open Interval [left, right)
int binarySearch(vector<int>& nums, int target) {
   int left = 0, right = nums.size();
   while (left < right) {
       int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
       if (nums[mid] == target) return mid;
       else if (nums[mid] < target) left = mid + 1;
       else right = mid;
   }
   return -1; // target not found
}
```

### Left-Closed Right-Closed Interval `[left, right]`

- The `left` pointer starts at 0, representing the first element of the array.
- The `right` pointer ends at `nums.size() - 1`, representing the position of the last element.
- Because this is a closed interval, we use `nums.size() - 1`.

```cpp
// Left-Closed Right-Closed Interval [left, right)
int binarySearch(vector<int>& nums, int target) {
   int left = 0, right = nums.size();
   while (left <= right) {
       int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
       if (nums[mid] == target) return mid;
       else if (nums[mid] < target) left = mid + 1;
       else right = mid;
   }
   return -1; // target not found
}
```

### Left-Open Right-Open Interval `(left, right)`

- The `left` pointer starts at -1, representing the position just before the first element of the array.
- The `right` pointer ends at `nums.size()`, representing the position just after the last element of the array.

The reason for setting the `left` and `right` pointers one position beyond the array bounds is to ensure that 
no elements are missed on either end. It's important to note that the while loop terminates when `left == right - 1`, 
meaning the `left` and `right` pointers are adjacent. This approach requires careful control of the logic, 
but you don't need to manually handle how to update the `left` and `right` pointersâ€”using `mid` takes care of it.

```cpp
// Left-Open Right-Open Interval (left, right)
int binarySearch(vector<int>& nums, int target) {
   int left = -1, right = nums.size();
   while (left < right - 1) {
       int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
       if (nums[mid] == target) return mid;
       else if (nums[mid] < target) left = mid;
       else right = mid;
   }
   return -1; // target not found
}
```
